# Night Mind

This theme is my take on my favorite dark themes [OneDarkPro](#) [NightOwl](#) [Moonlight](#). Rich text elements, with a dim UI and bright focus color used to direct attention to where you're active.

### Recommended Settings

This theme now uses editor bracket color defaults without any extentions.
settings.json (see other customization options below).

```json
  "editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled": true,
  "editor.renderLineHighlightOnlyWhenFocus": true,
  "editor.guides.highlightActiveBracketPair": true,
  "editor.guides.highlightActiveIndentation": true,
```

Matching word highlight is subtle, while search highlight stands out
